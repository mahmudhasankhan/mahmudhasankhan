### Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mahmud
<p align="Center"> <img align='center' src='https://media.giphy.com/media/bcKmIWkUMCjVm/giphy.gif' width='100"'></p> <p align="center"> 
Currently, working full-time as a Data Analyst in <a href="https://www.bracits.com/">Brac IT</a> where I put my analytical aptitude to the test by delivering analytical reports and visualizations. I also have strong interest in data engineering.
  
I have graduated with Magna Cum Laude from  <a href="http://www.northsouth.edu/">North South University </a> with a concentration in computer science and engineering in Summer 2022. My thesis work involved resolving the low-resource problem of the language "Bengali" in NLP. I proposed a carefully constructed and annotated Bengali dataset of 10 thousand texts collected from social media in the context of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine War. A benchmark classifier was developed by experimenting with several transformer-based language models all pre-trained on unlabeled Bangla corpus.
